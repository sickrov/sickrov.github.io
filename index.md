Security tips for Kubernetes
- Part 1 - Architecture
- Part 2 - Vulnerabilities
- Part 3 - Hardening


## PART 1 - ARCHITECTURE

### What does Kubernetes do?
- Allows to run container/s in a container engine.
- Schedule allows containers mission efficient.
- Keep containers alive.
- Allows container communications.
- Allows deployment techniques.
- Handle volumes of information.

### Architecture:
![https://i.postimg.cc/YS786tRP/Screenshot-68.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/YS786tRP/Screenshot-68.jpg)
- Node: operating system with pod or pods.
-- Pod: Wrapper around a container or multiple containers and it contains an app.
-- Kubelet: Primary node agent. The component that establishes communication between node and kubectl, and only can run pods (through api server).The kubelet doesn't manage containers which were not created by Kubernetes.
-- Kube-proxy: is the service in charge of the communications (services) between the apiserver and the node. The base is an IPtables for nodes. Most experienced users could install other kube-proxies from other vendors.
-- Sidecar container: Sidecar containers are the containers that should run along with the main container in the pod. This sidecar pattern extends and enhances the functionality of current containers without changing it. Nowadays, We know that we use container technology to wrap all the dependencies for the application to run anywhere. A container does only one thing and does that thing very well.

- Kubectl: Kubernetesâ€™s CLI, allows you to manage and deploy containers. You can inspect the cluster's resources. Communications with API server
- Scheduler: Scheduling refers to making sure that Pods are matched to Nodes so that Kubelet can run them Watches for newly Pods that have no Node assigned. This component assign pods with nodes
- etcd: Data storage, persistent, consistent and distributed. Is Kubernetes's database and the key value storage where it keeps the complete state of the clusters.
- Kube Controller manager: check several resources, for example the replica sets or the deployments in order to check if for example we have the correct number of pods or nodes running. It controls replication, tokens and account services to the API.
- Cloud controller manager: Is the specific controller for flow controls and applications, i.e: if you have clusters in aws or openstack.

### How pods communicate with each other.
![https://i.postimg.cc/13wJV8G6/Screenshot-67.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/13wJV8G6/Screenshot-67.jpg)

### PKI infrastructure - Certificate Authority CA:
![https://i.postimg.cc/rp9jg7Yw/Screenshot-66.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/rp9jg7Yw/Screenshot-66.jpg)
- CA is the trusted root for all certificates inside the cluster
- Allows components to validate to each other.
- All cluster certificates are signed by the CA
- ETCd has its own certificate.
- types:
--apiserver cert
--kubelet cert
--scheduler cert




## PART 2 - VULNERABILITIES and some fixes.

### Vulnerabilities - kubernetes secrets
A Secret is an object that contains a small amount of sensitive data such as a password, a token, or a key. Such information might otherwise be put in a Pod specification or in an image. Users can create Secrets and the system also creates some Secrets.The name of a Secret object must be a valid DNS subdomain name.

Secrets can be things like:
- API, SSH Keys
- OAuth tokers
- Credentials, Passwords (plain text || b64 + encryption)
- Information or comments
- Database connection code, strings...

Secret types:
|Builtin Type|  Usage|
|-|-|
|Opaque|  arbitrary user-defined data|
|kubernetes.io/service-account-token| service account token
|kubernetes.io/dockercfg| serialized ~/.dockercfg file
|kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson|  serialized ~/.docker/config.json file
|kubernetes.io/basic-auth|  credentials for basic authentication
|kubernetes.io/ssh-auth|  credentials for SSH authentication
|kubernetes.io/tls| data for a TLS client or server
|bootstrap.kubernetes.io/token| bootstrap token data

### How secrets works:
![https://i.postimg.cc/C1CX5NX4/Screenshot-164.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/C1CX5NX4/Screenshot-164.jpg)
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#using-secrets-as-files-from-a-pod

Create a secret, commands:
```
kubectl create secret generic secret_01 --from-literal user=<user>
kubectl create secret generic secret_01 --from-literal password=<password>
kubectl run pod --image=nginx -oyaml --dry-run=client
kubectl run pod --image=nginx -oyaml --dry-run=client > <podName.yaml>
```

This is the generated file:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mypod
    image: redis
    volumeMounts:
    - name: <secret_01>
      mountPath: "/etc/<secret_01>"
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: <secret_01>
    secret:
      secretName: <secret_01>
      items:
      - key: username
        path: my-group/my-username
```
### Using Secrets as environment variables
If you want to use a secret in an environment variable in order to allow to the rest of the pods reference the same secret you could use:

In the <podName.yaml> you could add the uncomment lines:
```
#apiVersion: v1
#kind: Pod
#metadata:
#  name: secret-env-pod
#spec:
#  containers:
#  - name: mycontainer
#    image: redis
    env:
      - name: SECRET_USERNAME
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: mysecret
            key: username
#     - name: SECRET_PASSWORD
#        valueFrom:
#          secretKeyRef:
#            name: mysecret
#            key: password
#  restartPolicy: Never
```

The result is:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mypod
    image: redis
    env:
      - name: PASSWORD
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: <secret_02>
            key: <password>   
    volumeMounts:
    - name: <secret_01>
      mountPath: "/etc/<secret_01>"
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: <secret_01>
    secret:
      secretName: <secret_01>
      items:
      - key: username
        path: my-group/my-username
```
Save and:
```
kubectl -f <podName.yaml> delete --force
kubectl -f <podName.yaml> create
```
or:
```
kubectl -f <podName.yaml> replace --force
```

More info: 
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#using-secrets-as-environment-variables

### Discover secrets in docker:

To get the id of the container.
```
docker ps | grep <service> 
```
Inspect:
```
docker inspect <docker_id>
```

Check env (environment variable section) for secrets and you will see: 
- Passwords
- Ip's
- Ports
- Paths
- Others...

If you want to copy:
```
docker cp <docket_id>:/etc/<secret_01> <secret_01>
```

## Discover secrets in etcd:
Remember than etcd is a consistent and highly-available key value store used as Kubernetes backing store for all cluster data. 
Lets access to the secret in etcd:
```
cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml | grep etcd
```
You will see certs, keys and urls were are located in the FS. Once you get it, you would be able to connect into etcd.
```
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --cert <path to client.crt> --key <path to client.ket> --cacert <path to CA.cert> endpoint=[<ip:port>] health
i.e:
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-etcd-client.crt --key /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-etcd-client.key --cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/etcd/ca.cert endpoint=[127.0.0.1:1234] health
```
Once you achieve to establish communication you would be able to get the secrets:
```
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --cert <path to client.crt> --key <path to client.ket> --cacert <path to CA.cert> endpoint=[<ip:port>] get <path/to/secret>
i.e:
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-etcd-client.crt --key /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-etcd-client.key --cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/etcd/ca.cert endpoint=[127.0.0.1:1234] get /registry/secrets/default/secret_02
```

## Adding encryption to the ETCD
So, by default all the secrets are in plain text unless you apply an encription layer:
If the identity provider is empty of the default value = {} so the secrets are in plain text.
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/

#### Encryption types
| Name | Encryption | Strength | Speed | Key| 
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| identity | None | N/A | N/A | N/A | 
| aescbc | AES-CBC with PKCS#7 padding | Strongest | Fast | 32-byte | 
| secretbox | XSalsa20 and Poly1305 | Strong | Faster | 32-byte | 
| aesgcm | AES-GCM with random nonce | Must be rotated every 200k writes | Fastest | 16, 24, or 32-byte |
| kms | Uses envelope encryption scheme: Data is encrypted by data encryption keys (DEKs) using AES-CBC with PKCS#7 padding, DEKs are encrypted by key encryption keys (KEKs) according to configuration in Key Management Service (KMS) | Strongest | Fast | 32-bytes |
The secrets will be encrypted with the above algorithms and encoded by base64.
```
kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f -
```

#### How to encrypt the ETCD
Create a directory in /etc/kubernetes ; in this case you will name it as etcd so you have:
```
/etc/kubernetes/etcd
```
You create a yaml file with the configuration.
```
vi <configFile.yaml>
```
You can copy the content of https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/


```
apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: EncryptionConfiguration
resources:
  - resources:
    - secrets
    providers:
    - aescbc:
        keys:
        - name: key1
          secret: <your pass in b64>
    - identity: {}
```
Generate pass in b64 (remember to use a pass character with lenght = 16 || = 24 || = 32 :
```
echo -n <password> | base64
```
You can see how the encryption provider is not setting. 

After that, you have to edit the file /etc/kubernetes/manifest/kube-apiserver.yaml and add the following lines into the sections:
And add the following line at:
spec:
```
  containers:
  - command:
    - kube-apiserver
    - --encriyption-provider-config=/etc/kubernetes/etcd/<configFile.yaml>
```
Scroll down in the volumeMounts:
```
- mountPath: /etc/kubernetes/etcd
    name: etcd
    readOnly: true
```
Scroll down in the volumeMounts to hostPath:
```
- hostPath:
    path: /etc/kubernetes/etcd
    type: DirectoryOrCreate
  name: etcd
```

### Get information about the secrets.
```
kubectl get secret
kubectl get secret <secret_name> -oyaml
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl get /registry/secrets/default/secret1 [...] | hexdump -C
kubectl create secret generic test-secret --from-literal='username=my-app' --from-literal='password=45tRf$we34rR'
```

With root access: # kubectl get secret
```
kubectl get secret test-secret -oyaml
```

Do not forget to delete de secrets and re-create them again in order to apply the encryption layer.
### Final tips:
- Try not to keep secrets in the FS, get them from other places.
- Check out https://www.vaultproject.io/ for add more protection to your secrets.

## Vulnerabilities - Container runtime sandboxes

How an attack with lateral movement and privesc could be done:
![https://i.postimg.cc/445jTWzf/Screenshot-161.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/445jTWzf/Screenshot-161.jpg)

Getting inside the container:
```
kubectl get node
kubectl run pod --image=<image_name>
kubectl exec pod -it -- bash
```
Once inside the container:
```
root@pod01:/# uname -r
```
If you want to gather information you could use:
```
strace uname -r
ltrace uname -r
```
When the attack achieve discover the kernel version he could run exploiting techniques in order to gather information or escalate into the OS.

For secure sandboxes:
- gVisor:
https://github.com/google/gvisor
- Katakontainers: 
https://katacontainers.io/


## Vulnerabilities - OS
Is mandatory to keep in mind to define privilege and access control for container / pod:
- userID's and groupID's
- Privileged or unpriviliged escalation runs.
- Linux

More info at:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/

### userID and groupID
```
# kubectl run pod --image=busybox --command -oyaml --dry-run=client > <podName.yaml> -- sh -c 'sleep 1h'
# vi <podName>.yaml
```

Add the uncomment lines:
```
#apiVersion: v1
#kind: Pod
#metadata:
#  name: security-context-demo
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1000
    runAsGroup: 3000
    fsGroup: 2000
#  volumes:
#  - name: sec-ctx-vol
#    emptyDir: {}
#  containers:
#  - name: sec-ctx-demo
#    image: busybox
#    command: [ "sh", "-c", "sleep 1h" ]
   securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true
#    volumeMounts:
#    - name: sec-ctx-vol
#      mountPath: /data/demo
#    securityContext:
#      allowPrivilegeEscalation: true
```
Save and:
```
# kubectl -f <podName>.yaml delete --force
# kubectl -f <podName>.yaml create
```

Check permissions:
```
# kubectl exec -it <podName> -- sh
```
### How to disable privilege escalation:
```
vi <podName>.yaml
```

Set this line to false
```
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
```
Save and:
```
kubectl -f <podName>.yaml delete --force
kubectl -f <podName>.yaml create
```

### Modify PodSecurityPolicy
Pod security policies controls the security policies about how a pod has to run.
More info at:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/

Edit the kube-apiserver.yaml file
```
vi /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
```
Inside you add in
```
- --enable-admission-plugins=NodeRestriction,PodSecurityPolicy
```



## Vulnerabilities - mTLS
Mutual authentication, two way, pod to pod

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/

### Create a sidecar proxy app
Create your <appName>.yaml
```
kubectl run app --image=bash --comand -oyaml --dry-run=client > <appName.yaml> -- shj -c 'ping google.com'
```
Edit your <appName>.yaml and add the uncomment lines:
```
#apiVersion: v1
#kind: Pod
#metadata:
#  name: security-context-demo
#spec:
#  securityContext:
#    runAsUser: 1000
#    runAsGroup: 3000
#    fsGroup: 2000
#  volumes:
#  - name: sec-ctx-vol
#    emptyDir: {}
#  containers:
#  - name: sec-ctx-demo
#    image: busybox
    command: [ "sh", "-c", "apt update && apt install iptables -y && iptables -L && sleep 1h" ]
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add: ["NET_ADMIN"]
 #   volumeMounts:
 #   - name: sec-ctx-vol
 #     mountPath: /data/demo
 #   securityContext:
 #     allowPrivilegeEscalation: true
```
See the logs of the proxy:
```
kubectl logs app -C proxy
```

## PART 3 - HARDENING.

### 3.1 CLUSTER HARDENING -  RBAC
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/
RBAC = Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within your organization.
RBAC authorization uses the rbac.authorization.k8s.io API group to drive authorization decisions, allowing you to dynamically configure policies through the Kubernetes API.

To enable RBAC, start the API server with the --authorization-mode flag set to a comma-separated list that includes RBAC; for example:
```
kube-apiserver --authorization-mode=Example,RBAC --other-options --more-options
```
This is enable by default.
RBAC functions:
- Restrict the access to the resources to users or ServiceAccounts.
- An RBAC Role or ClusterRole contains rules that represent a set of permissions. 
- Permissions are purely additive (there are no "deny" rules).
- RBAC works with Roles and Bindings

Principle of Least Privilege is meaning of only access to data or information when is necessary for a legitimate purpose.

#### Types of resources:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/
##### Concept of namespaces:
Kubernetes supports multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster. These virtual clusters are called namespaces. These are intended for use in environments with many users spread across multiple teams, or projects. For clusters with a few to tens of users, you should not need to create or think about namespaces at all. Start using namespaces when you need the features they provide.

Namespaces provide a scope for names. Names of resources need to be unique within a namespace, but not across namespaces. Namespaces cannot be nested inside one another and each Kubernetes resource can only be in one namespace.

##### Viewing namespaces:
You can list the current namespaces in a cluster using:
```
kubectl get namespace
NAME              STATUS   AGE
default           Active   1d
kube-node-lease   Active   1d
kube-public       Active   1d
kube-system       Active   1d
```
##### Setting the namespace preference 
You can permanently save the namespace for all subsequent kubectl commands in that context.
```
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=<insert-namespace-name-here>
```

Not All Objects are in a Namespace. Most Kubernetes resources (e.g. pods, services, replication controllers, and others) are in some namespaces. However namespace resources are not themselves in a namespace. And low-level resources, such as nodes and persistentVolumes, are not in any namespace.

To see which Kubernetes resources are and aren't in a namespace:
##### In a namespace
```
kubectl api-resources --namespaced=true
```
##### Not in a namespace
```
kubectl api-resources --namespaced=false
```

### Difference between Role and ClusterRole:

##### Role:
RBAC allows to set different permissions for the same role with independence of the namespace.
Roles example:
```
/api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/pods/{name}/log

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: defaultGreen
  name: pod-and-pod-logs-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods", "pods/log"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
```
Other example, same Role different nameSpace and permissions:
```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: defaultYellow
  name: pod-and-pod-logs-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods", "pods/log"]
  verbs: ["watch"]
```
##### ClusterRole:
A ClusterRole can be used to grant the same permissions as a Role. Because ClusterRoles are cluster-scoped, you can also use them to grant access to:

- cluster-scoped resources (like nodes)
- non-resource endpoints (like /healthz)
- namespaced resources (like Pods), across all namespaces

For example: you can use a ClusterRole to allow a particular user to run:
```
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```
##### ClusterRole example:
```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  # "namespace" omitted since ClusterRoles are not namespaced
  name: secret-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  #
  # at the HTTP level, the name of the resource for accessing Secret
  # objects is "secrets"
  resources: ["secrets"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```


#### Role and ClusterRole Binding concept:
A role binding grants the permissions defined in a role to a user or set of users. It holds a list of subjects (users, groups, or service accounts), and a reference to the role being granted. A RoleBinding grants permissions within a specific namespace whereas a ClusterRoleBinding grants that access cluster-wide.

A RoleBinding may reference any Role in the same namespace. Alternatively, a RoleBinding can reference a ClusterRole and bind that ClusterRole to the namespace of the RoleBinding. If you want to bind a ClusterRole to all the namespaces in your cluster, you use a ClusterRoleBinding.

RoleBinding example:
```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
# This role binding allows "jane" to read pods in the "default" namespace.
# You need to already have a Role named "pod-reader" in that namespace.
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: default
subjects:
# You can specify more than one "subject"
- kind: User
  name: jane # "name" is case sensitive
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  # "roleRef" specifies the binding to a Role / ClusterRole
  kind: Role #this must be Role or ClusterRole
  name: pod-reader # this must match the name of the Role or ClusterRole you wish to bind to
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

 ClusterRoleBinding example:
```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
# This cluster role binding allows anyone in the "manager" group to read secrets in any namespace.
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-secrets-global
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: manager # Name is case sensitive
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: secret-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```
Permissions are additive so if you have a clusterRole with "list" and "delete" secrets you can add it with a Role with "get".
So be aware and test always your roles and permissions and specify what is ALLOWED, because everything is DENIED.


### 3.2 SERVICE ACCOUNTS HARDENING
#### ACCOUNTS
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/service-accounts-admin/
Users: 
- Accounts for "persons" who hold a certificate integrated with the Kubernetes Identity Management of cloud providers.
- There is no Kubernetes user resource.
- A user have a Key and a Cert.

##### How it works:
Openssl --> CSR (CertificateSigningRequest) --> CertificateSignedRequest --> Kubernetes API <-- CA

Be aware of the certificates because there is no way to invalidate them, you have yo wait until the expiration date reaches. So what could you do in case you have to restrict the access?

- Create new CA and reissue all certificates.
- Remove all RBAC access

#### ServiceAccounts:
 - Accounts for "machines". Is managed by the kubernetes API
 - Namespaced
 - Can interact with the Kubernetes API
 - The "Default" SA is in every namespaced used by the PODS.
 

### 3.3 KUBERNETES API HARDENING

API requests are always assigned to a User, ServiceAccount or Anonymous request. After the request must be authenticated.
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet-authentication-authorization/

##### Request process:
User or K8s ServiceAccount --> Authentication --> Authorization --> Admission Control.

TIPS:
- Close ports
- Avoid Anonymous access
- NodeRestriction; No access from specific nodes to the API
  - https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#noderestriction
  - Basicaly prevents kubelets from adding/removing/updating labels with a node-restriction.kubernetes.io/ prefix. This label prefix is reserved for administrators to label their Node objects for workload isolation purposes, and kubelets will not be allowed to modify labels with that prefix.
  - And also, allows kubelets to add/remove/update these labels and label prefixes
- Ensure with labels the secure workload isolation.
- Avoid specific pods from API access.
- Avoid ApiServer exposure to the internet.
- Avoid unauthorized access RBAC.
- ApiServer port with firewall and IP whitelisting.


### 3.4 KUBERNETES CLUSTER HARDENING

Upgrade it frecuently, you will receive:
- Dependencies up to date.
- Bug and security patches.

Release cycles:
Each 3 months there is a new minor release
https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/
1.20.3 = 1(Major).20(Minor).3(patch)

  
##### Best way to update or upgrade a Kubernetes Cluster:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cluster-upgrade/
- Upgrade the Master Node components following this sequence:
  - etcd (all instances)
  - kube-apiserver (all control plane hosts)
  - kube-controller-manager
  - kube-scheduler
  - cloud controller manager, if you use one.

- Upgrade the Worker Node components such as: kube-proxy, kubelet.
